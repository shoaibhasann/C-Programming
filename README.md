## Introduction

This repository serves as a record of my C programming journey. I started from the basics, gradually advancing to more complex topics. Feel free to explore the code and projects as I learn and improve my C programming skills.

## Learning Path

1. **Basics:** The `basics` directory contains code snippets and small programs covering fundamental concepts like variables, data types, loops, and conditional statements.

2. **Intermediate:** As I progressed, I delved into more advanced topics such as functions, arrays, pointers, and structures. The `intermediate` directory contains code related to these concepts.

3. **Programs:** The `programs` directory showcases my problem solving skills using advanced C programming topics, including file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and advanced data structures.

## Projects

I've also worked on practical projects to apply my C programming skills. Check out the `projects` directory for details on each project, including their purpose and implementation.

## Contributing

If you have suggestions for improvements, find any issues, or want to contribute to my learning journey, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
